# Faculty Websites Feed File Generating Scripts for Imperial Valley College

This repository will hold the scripts that will generate the Feed Files that will be imported via the Faculty Websites Command Line Import Process.

## Getting started steps

Once the project progresses a little more I'll start writing some getting started and usage documentation and include it here in the README (or add the additional documentation files to the repository).
